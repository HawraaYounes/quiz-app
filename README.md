# Quiz Application

## Overview

This project is a quiz application built using ReactJS. The main objective of this app is to provide an interactive and engaging platform for users to solve quizzes with multiple-choice questions and then display their results. It showcases my skills in frontend development, particularly in creating dynamic user interfaces and managing state in React.

## Features

- **React Essentials**: The project demonstrates key React concepts including:
  - **Components**: Breaking down the UI into reusable, independent pieces.
  - **JSX**: Using JSX syntax to structure the components.
  - **Props**: Passing data between components via props.
  - **State**: Managing component state to handle quiz data and interactions.
  - **React Hooks**:
    - **useRef**: Used for creating a reference to manage quiz timers.
    - **useEffect**: Used for side effects such as timer countdown and managing the component lifecycle.
- **Quiz Functionality**: 
  - **Multiple Choice Questions**: Users can select answers from multiple choices.
  - **Submit Quiz**: Users can submit their answers to see the results.
  - **Display Results**: Show the user's score and correct answers after quiz submission.
  - **Question Timer**: Each question has a timer. If the timer expires without an answer being selected, the question is treated as skipped.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the application is accessible and usable on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - **ReactJS**: Used for building the frontend components and managing state.
